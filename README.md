# Implicit-Methods-for-ODE-Matlab
This is a structure for 2nd order linear ODE solver using the Implicit Method. here are two methods  1. Crank-Nicolson 2.Implicit Euler. Anyone can use this code just by varying the desired equation in the last part of the code. I built in on the base of our professors lecture.
